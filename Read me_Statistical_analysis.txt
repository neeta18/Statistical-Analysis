STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Q1)Analyze the dataset in as many ways possible ways, including multivariate analysis,to generate insights for predictive modeling.
(Other suggestions for analysis – [Correlation,Covariance, ANOVA, Regression analysis, Hypothesis testing:Student’s t-test, chi-square test 
(Generate Null and Alternatehypothesis and find the significant relation)].

Soln: Steps followed while performing Statistical Analysis
     a. Loading the necessary Libraries
     b. Loading data
     c. Variable Identification
     d. Univariate Analysis for numerical and categorical variables using distribution plot,barplot and countplot.
     e. Boxplot Analysis 
     f. Feature Engineering(generate new columns from DATE)
     g. Correlation Analysis(Heat map using correlation matrix)
     h. Regression Analysis(using Pairplot)
     i. Chi-square test of Independence for Categorical Variables/Features
        Hypothesis testing : Null Hypothesis: 2 variables are independent.Alternate Hypothesis: 2 variables are not independent.
